  <h1>Profile at a Glance</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>My motto in life is to nourish and strengthen my passion for programming, creativity, analytical skills, research, teaching and public speaking, in order to bring 
    about the best in me while doing something for the society. As a budding engineer and a public speaker, I have always voiced out my opinions, thoughts and perspectives 
    on topics and ideas which are worth spreading. A dedicated and hardworking individual, I welcome challenges with a smile and grab every relevant opportunity that comes
    my way. Iâ€™m passionate about programming and I have indulged in research activities in various technical domains over the last few years. I have been shouldering 
    leadership positions right from my school days and I consider myself to be a strong team player. I have led a plethora of teams and clubs and this has allowed me to 
    develop and nurture the sense of responsibility and sportsman spirit. Teaching has always been my passion and I have conducted technical workshops, sessions and classes 
    on coding and related subjects. My main aim in life is to not just develop projects that would create an optimistic impact in the society, but to also share the 
    knowledge, experience and skills gained so far to the thriving tech communities out there with a special focus on those who hardly have access to sufficient resources and opportunities. </p>
