			<p>
        I'm Meghna Manoj Nair, a final year CS student from India. My motto in life is to nourish and strengthen my passion for programming, creativity, analytical skills, research, teaching and public speaking, in order to bring about the best in me while doing something for the society. As a budding engineer and a public speaker, I have always voiced out my opinions, thoughts and perspectives on topics and ideas which are worth spreading. A dedicated and hardworking individual, I welcome challenges with a smile and grab every relevant opportunity that comes my way. I‚Äôm passionate about programming and I have indulged in research activities in various technical domains over the last few years.
				<br>
				<br>I have been shouldering leadership positions right from my school days and I consider myself to be a strong team player. I have led a plethora of teams and clubs and this has allowed me to develop and nurture the sense of responsibility and sportsman spirit. Teaching has always been my passion and I have conducted technical workshops, sessions and classes on coding and related subjects. My main aim in life is to not just develop projects that would create an optimistic impact in the society, but to also share the knowledge, experience and skills gained so far to the thriving tech communities out there with a special focus on those who hardly have access to sufficient resources and opportunities. My commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, equality, and a rational mindset is what keeps me hustling in this world!
